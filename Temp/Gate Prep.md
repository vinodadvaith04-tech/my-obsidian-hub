Section 1  
Reasoning and Comprehension This part is to test the candidate’s ability to comprehend and interpret written information – skills that  are critical to research in the Humanities and Social Sciences. The section will not directly test language  competence in terms of grammar, vocabulary etc. The focus is instead on critical reasoning (similar to  what is often found in exams like LSAT, GRE, GMAT etc.) and analysis of the text and its stylistic and  rhetorical structure.

Questions of this section XH-B1 will test the following skills:

• Reading Comprehension – ability to understand complex language material in short paragraphs  and answer questions regarding them.  
• Expression – questions on stylistic and rhetorical aspects of a short passage including corrections  or modifications of particular sentences.

• Analytical reasoning – ability to understand relationships in statements or short passages and  being able to draw reasonable conclusions/inferences from them.  
• Logical reasoning – Thinking critically to evaluate or to predict an argument, identify the main  and supporting arguments, predict outcomes etc.
