### Genetics

Gene as unit of inheritance 
Mendel's laws
pedigree analysis
multi-allele and -gene inheritance
gene interactions
sex linkage
sex determination
extra-nuclear inheritance
linkage mapping
recombination
chromosome aberrations.

### Evolution 

History of evolutionary biology. 
Concepts of natural selection, adaptation, drift, neutral vs. adaptive evolution. 
Microevolutionary processes (measuring genetic variation, processes affecting allele frequencies, natural and sexual selection, fitness concepts). 
Speciation processes ( species concepts, speciation rates, reproductive barriers. 
Basics of phylogenetics (classification, phylogenetic trees, parsimony, molecular clock). 
Macroevolutionary processes (origin of life, major transitions, extinctions, radiation), fossil records and biogeography. 
Basics of genome evolution (genome size and composition, evo-devo, systems biology).
