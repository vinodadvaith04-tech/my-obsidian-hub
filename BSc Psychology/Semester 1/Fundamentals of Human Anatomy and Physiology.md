**Levels of Organization**

Introduction to Physiology; Molecular, Cellular and Tissue Physiology; Principles of homeostasis; cell organelles; membranes – permeability and transport.


**Introduction to Biochemistry**

Introducing the role of biochemistry and its relationship to life processes. Biomolecules and Carbohydrates -    Classification; Proteins- Amino acids- -peptide bond -Proteins-biological importance-classification based on solubility and composition-levels of organization-primary, secondary (alpha -helix and beta -pleated Sheet) and tertiary structure, (forces stabilizing it)-quaternary structure;  Enzymes- Classification-active site-specificity-Fischer and Koshland models-Enzyme kinetics;

Nucleic Acids- Types-components of nucleic acids-nucleosides and nucleotides-poly nucleotides-structure of DNA- (Watson and Crick model) biological roles of DNA and RNA. Central dogma of molecular biology; Replication of DNA- semi-conservative mechanism.


**Elementary endocrinology and neurochemistry**

Hormones and Neurotransmitters; source, sink receptor and related pathology.

Nutrition Biochemistry - Vitamins-definition-classification and deficiency manifestations of water soluble and fat soluble vitamins-coenzyme functions of B-complex vitamins;

Biological Oxidation - Bioenergetics-ATP and other high energy molecules-energy coupling in biological reactions-stepwise process of biological oxidation; Metabolism (Catabolism and anabolism) Carbohydrate metabolism, Fatty acid metabolism and Protein metabolism.
