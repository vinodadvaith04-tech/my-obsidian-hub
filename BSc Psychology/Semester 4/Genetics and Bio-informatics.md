**Introductory Genetics, Mendelian Concepts and Deviations**

Mendel’s work on transmission of traits - Genetic Variation - Molecular basis of Genetic Information. Principles of Inheritance, Chromosome theory of inheritance, Laws of Probability, Pedigree analysis - Inheritance patterns of traits: autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked recessive, X-linked dominant and Y-linked; and simple problems. Deviations from Mendelian ratio with special reference to examples from animals: Allelic interaction - Incomplete dominance, Codominance and Multiple allelism. Gene interaction - types of Epistasis. Sex-linked traits, Polygenic and Multifactorial traits.


**Genetic Alterations and Genetic disorders**

Genetic Alterations - Deletion, Duplication, Inversion and Translocation. Aneuploidy and Polyploidy. Genetic Disorders - Down Syndrome, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Fragile X Syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner Syndrome, Phenylketonuria, Cri du chat, Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Progeria, OsteogenesisImperfecta, Hemophilia.



**Identification of genetic disorders and Genetic Counseling**

Molecular Biology techniques for identification of genetic disorders: Agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR, Fingerprinting; DNA sequencing; Chromosomal tests - Karyotyping, FISH, Genetic tests with reference to newborn screening, diagnostic testing, Carrier testing, prenatal testing, Pre-implantation testing etc. Genetic Counseling - significance and procedure. Pedigree analysis


**Gene and Cancer**

DNA repair mechanisms, DNA repair defects and their relationship to cancer, Angiogenesis Cell cycle control and the pRb tumor suppressor Apoptosis and the p53 tumor suppressor Cellular senescence Telomeres, cellular immortalization, and tumorigenesis Mechanisms of oncogene activation Role of growth factors and receptors in carcinogenesis, RAS signalling in cancer, Familial cancer syndromes and the discovery of tumor suppressors



**Introduction to Bioinformatics and Database**

What is bioinformatics? Relation with molecular biology. Biological Database and its types. Introduction to data types and Source. Population and sample, Classification and Presentation of Data. Quality of data, private and public data sources. General Introduction of Biological Databases - Nucleic acid databases; Protein databases Structure databases.
