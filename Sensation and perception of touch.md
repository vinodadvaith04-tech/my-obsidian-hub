*Perception is multimodal, individual stimulus not enough, gestalt principle??*


##### *Somatosensory system*
	*Force/pressure*
	*Temperature*
	*Porprioception*
	*Pain*

*Both a survival and social background to sense of touch and thermal&tactile input*

*Weight of object being judged differently because of temperature*
*Wetness sensation, we don’t have water senses.* 
	*Mecano+thermo make us feel wet.*
	*Mixture of the 2* 


*Mouse model* 
	*Enhancement of stimulus*
	*Cool and touch and both stimulus* 
	*Comparing touch, cool, and in both measuring brain activity in brain cells responsible for this.* 
	*Enhancement perception when there is cool plus touch*

*Recruitment of more neurons for both stimulus, and dynamics of response changes*

*No warm representation*
*Insular cortex is where warmth is perceived* 
*Trypm8*

***Technology***
*Sensory restoration*
*Phosphenes*
