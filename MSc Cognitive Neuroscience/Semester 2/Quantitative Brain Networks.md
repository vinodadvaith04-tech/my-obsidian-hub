  Electrophysiology 
  Always extracellular tissue, 
  local field potential- all below 200hz(low pass)
  Passing through high pass - high frequencies, action potentials, 
  **Local field potentials vs spikes** debate??
  EEG, Ecog, LFP, Laminar, Microelectrod
  
  You work with fields more since it is replicable, and easily detectable and hence can be used as a form of therapy\
  Primary currents and secondary(volume currents)
  Divergence of both would be equal?
  Primary current - How much influx in a certain volume due to a synaptic input
