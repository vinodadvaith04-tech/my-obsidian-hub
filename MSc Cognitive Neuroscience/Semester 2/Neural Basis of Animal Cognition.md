Spatial cell types 
	Grid cells
	Border cells
	Head direction cells
	Place cells

Place cells have a predictive coding, signalling intended destination
Animals when trained in a particular maze, start to predict or remember the direction. 
This place cells fire prior to the movement done


When animals are put in a treadmill that has movement but no directional change
Are place cells activated then??
Different cells are activated at different times

Place and grid cells get activated during different stimulus(auditory task/conditioning)

Reccurrant excitation state. Activity in one side of a network, everything else is quite
other places stay silent. Hippocampus is a fast learner, and good at specific firing. 

### Replay

**constructive episodic simulation"** framework
Episodic imagination. People with bilateral hippocampus amnesia, they can’t imagine properly. Hippocampus maybe controls mental time travel. Future, past, and even placing imaginative events. 

Replay in the hippocampus happens most often during sleep. Irregular oscillations.
