### **Somatosensory system 1**

Vibro
Peripheral encoding of vibration features 

PC - sensitive to vibrations, more sensitive to temporal properties or frequencies

RA - not sensitive but for medium sized vibrations 
SA1 - for very high amplitude, sensitive for noises and diharmonics, especially as the amplitude is increased. 

Stimuli vs response is faithfully transfered between when you increase the frequency and amplitudes. 

Information from the different mechanoreceptors are integrated before going to S1

What happens

PC fine tune the spiking response of the temporal pattern
RA do the entire intensity



**Proprioception**

detects muscle length 
as well as acceleration 

Golgi tendon organ 
	Muscle tension or exertion 
	but not sensitive to geometric aspects of movement 
	Measures torque at a certain joint

Illusions of limb movement
	Vibrator at a tendon
	Vibration of a tendon tends to make that area feel stretched 


Multi join model, many models are coded per neuron or area.
Approximately 8 joints being encoded in areas 3A, 2 and M1

joint length transformation to a 3d spatial information 
How does you brain know where your hand is, 

Each neuron encodes for a certain movement direction
6 movement directions in 3d space
monotonic coding
it codes only stimulus in one direction
Tuning profile is usully bell shaped
Here it is sensitive to the whole work space, but codes only across one dimension 






### **Somatosensory system 2**
Somatosensory - tactile and proprioceptive neurons integrate in area 2 and 5 .
Posture/hand position shows a certain activation pattern, however cutaneous input changes that. 
**Illusion of limb movement**
Pinocchio illusion 
	Vibration on the bicep tendon as you grab you nose

How does the brain find object size
Tactile localisation 

**Multi sensory integration**
Modalities have different reliability in terms of location 
	Vision having the most
	Followed by proprioception
	Sound is unreliable

Optimal object size perception 
Weighting one modality over this other
