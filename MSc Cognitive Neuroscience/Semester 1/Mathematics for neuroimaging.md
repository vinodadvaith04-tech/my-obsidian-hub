Matrix x Vector multiplication 
Output subspace is the number of rows of the matrix
Number of linearly independent variables will be the columns in the matrix or the rows in the vector

y=Mx

Consider all the remainder an error, such that the set of equations fit

Pseudo inverse?

M x pinv(M) = the projection of y on the m space
