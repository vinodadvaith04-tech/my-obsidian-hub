PSTD in animal models
DSM5 criteria of ptsd
Underlying cause of why some people are resilient and some people are susceptible to trauma
SEFL paradigm 
PTSD like behaviours 
	Dark light transfer 
		hesitate to move to the light side of the box
	Marble burying 
		To measure anxiety 
	Accoustic startle and pre p inhibition 
		d
	Light phase activity 
		to check trouble sleeping 
		How much they are moving/sleeping in the dark phase and the light phase
Neural mechanism inside the brain
High emotional memory, 
Low contextual memory

Normal brain memory formation vs trauma patients

Hippocampus
	ventral, has lower dentritic tree size?
	before trauma it is the same
	after trauma, suseptible bahe a decreased blood flow in the hippocapmus 
	blood flow is correlated to the number of symptoms that is experienced
	arc TRAP mic

Permanent access to the neurons that were active

Encoding and retrieval is being modeled 

During encoding hippocampus activity does not explain what is happening in trauma susceptible mice.
During retrieval, ventral hippocampus is used, for resiliance mice. Marked by increased acetylation levels 

##### Chronic imbalance in large scale neural network
[[Triple network theory]]
Stress induced imbalance in neural network
iDISCO
	Remove the lipids from the brain to make it more see through
	add antibodies, tdTomato signal
	Light sheet microscope.
DIfferent types of stains for different parts of the brain. tagging
