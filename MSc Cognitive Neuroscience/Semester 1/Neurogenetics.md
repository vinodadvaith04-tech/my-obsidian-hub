Neurophysiology 

Dendrites consist more of microtubule base(cytoskeleton)
Dendritic spine consists of more of Actin. Actin polymerisation in it. 



Rho GTPases
Does more actin polymerisation??

Lond term potentiation vs long term depression 

Neurons that fire together wire together??

CaMKII(Kinase)

AMPA receptor(glutamate receptor) is the main receptor
NMDA is the coincidence receptor, when depolarized the Mg blocking the receptor, is removed, and at the same moment if glutamate binds to NMDA, then there is a huge flow of calcium into the cell. That flow of calcium then goes into the cell and binds to CaMKII kinase. This stimulates actin? And now AMPA receptors move towards the post synaptic synapnse. 

2 photon imaging
2 photons with different wavelengths, and only when the waves overlap is when we see the image. 

Inactive glutamate(caged), this glutamate activates only in the presence of light. 


Kinase(KNockout mice for the first time) Those mice could not learn
Has 2 states
Activated by calcium

AMPAr insertion during long term potentiation 
AMPA being incorporated onto the surface

millisecond for calcium
seconds for CaMKII
Minutes for AMPA insertions 

RHOGTPase activations during LTP
CDC42 stays in the same spine
RHOA diffuses to nearby spines
RAC1 diffuses to nearby spines

### Genes and its affected pathways
![[Pasted image 20251203134045.png]]
Multiple pathways 
Some genes dont code for any pathway but for splicing or etc
#### Synaptic dysfunction is one of the most important thing to look for
Many genes code for synaptic 
When taking brain autopsy, the dendritic spines always look different
Post mortem - never the best, causative?(chicken or egg), too long to preserve after death
Almost all disorders result in synaptic deficit

#### modelling
